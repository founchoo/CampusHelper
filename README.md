## Thanks

During the development, we have used the following tools/website which are helpful:

- https://www.composables.com/icons A website generating **Material Symbols for Jetpack Compose**.

  You just need to copy it and paste to you `.kt` file. It will generate a function named `rememberIconName`, and to use it, just call the function, so easy and simple.

- https://stackoverflow.com/ StackOverflow of course, a knowledge sharing community which gained a lot of population.
  In the development, there are so many times when we refer to it and seek suggestions.

- https://m3.material.io/ Material Design guidelines.

- https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary Official development document.

- https://google.github.io/accompanist/placeholder/ Placeholder for Jetpack Compose.

- https://json2kt.com/ Convert `JSON` to `.kt` file
